## Instructions

## Introduction

[Instagram](instagram.com) is an ultra popular mobile app to share photos.

### Iteration 1 | User Profile Pictures

We've already provided a `User` model and the authentication logic. Unfortunately, the user doesn't have a profile picture.

Fix the User Registration so that it allows the user to upload a file as their profile image.

### Iteration 2 | Posts

In this iteration, create the bread and butter of Instagram, the Post.

A post should have the following attributes:

- `content` - Text belonging to the post
- `creatorId` - ObjectId of the post's creator
- `pictureUrl` - Where the picture is stored
- `pictureName` - The picture's name

For this iteration you must create the **model**, along with the **new**, **create**, **show** and **index** routes. This should include file uploading.

A user should be logged in to create a post, but _not_ to view.

The **index** will be the home page, and simply display all of the posts on the website.

### Iteration 3 | Comments

Posts have comments attached to them. Create the `Comment` model as a subdocument of the `Post`. You can read more about subdocuments in the [mongoose documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html).

A comment _can_ have images attached to it, but not all do.

The model should have the following attributes:

- `content`
- `authorId`
- `imageUrl`
- `imageName`

You should create routes to create new comments. Comments should be displayed on the Post _show_ page.

Happy Coding ðŸ’™
